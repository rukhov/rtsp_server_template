# Easy RTSP streamer
This project aims to develop a user-friendly C++ library for streaming RTSP directly from memory buffers. While built upon the robust GStreamer and gst-rtsp-server frameworks (written in C), the library provides a modern C++ interfaceâ€”making it more accessible to developers accustomed to contemporary C++ paradigms.
